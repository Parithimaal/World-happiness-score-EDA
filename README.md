## Dataset

The dataset contains **792 rows and 13 columns**, representing happiness indicators across different countries. The key columns include:

- **Happiness Score**: The average of responses to the primary life evaluation question from the Gallup World Poll (GWP) on a scale of 0-10.

- **Family**: The extent to which family support contributes to happiness.
- **Health**: Life expectancy and its contribution to happiness.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis includes:

1. **Preliminary Inferences**: A broad overview of happiness scores and their distribution.
2. **Happiness Score by Country**: Visualization of happiness scores across all countries.
3. **Happiness Score by Continent**: Breakdown of scores across different continents.
4. **GDP per Capita by Continent**: Exploring the economic aspect of happiness.
5. **Contribution of Happiness Components**:
   - Europe: Breakdown of key factors influencing happiness.
   - Africa: A comparison of different happiness contributors.
6. **Happiness Trends Over Time**: Tracking how happiness scores have changed.
7. **Comparing the Happiest and Saddest Countries**: Identifying key contrasts.

## Visualizations

The project includes multiple visualizations using **Seaborn, Plotly, and Matplotlib**:

- **Happiness Score Maps**: Geographic representation of happiness distribution.
- **GDP vs Happiness Correlation**: Scatter plots showing economic impact.
- **Heatmaps**: Composite view of factors affecting happiness.

## Key Findings

- Economic prosperity (GDP per capita) strongly correlates with happiness.
- Family and health play significant roles in determining happiness scores.
- Certain continents have stark contrasts in happiness levels due to economic and social factors.
- Happiness scores have shown notable shifts over time, influenced by global events.
